# chargerTracker
as someone who constantly loses their charger, i made this to help me keep track of where i had it last

Works with Mac OSX. Uses terminal and subprocesses. Easy, runs the background.

It will create a JSON file on your computer, if you care

------------------------------USAGE--------------------------------------

run the file, it will automatically start tracking charging times
while its running, use these commands

-r: gets most recent time and date your computer was charged

-l: gets full list of charging times and dates

-q: quits

-s: gets status of charging right now
